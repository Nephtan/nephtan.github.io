                <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> The road to Alderwood stretched out before you, a winding ribbon of dirt and gravel cutting through rolling hills and sparse woodland. The sky overhead was a patchwork of gray clouds, promising another overcast day, though mercifully free of rain for now. The air was cool and damp, carrying the earthy scent of the previous night's rain.

Ludrec walked with a steady, measured pace, his eyes scanning the horizon. His cloak, a simple but sturdy garment, flapped gently in the breeze. Beside him, Fate and Destiny Eddie moved with a practiced ease, their eyes reflecting the road's distant promises. Fate's blonde hair caught the occasional glint of the weak sunlight filtering through the clouds, while Destiny's red locks seemed almost to defy the gloom around them.

Rue Dhal, ever the silent shadow, moved with a grace that spoke of years spent navigating the unseen corners of the world. His eyes darted from shadow to shadow, always alert, always watchful. Alastair Shadowsbane, his expression one of unwavering resolve, brought up the rear. His gaze was steady, focused, as if seeking omens in the landscape around them.

The journey had been long, and the road had offered little in the way of comfort or diversion. But Alderwood lay ahead, and with it, the promise of gold and perhaps something more. The contract was simple: find the missing adventurers or bring back news of their fate. The reward was substantial, enough to make the hardships of the road worth enduring.

As the day wore on, the landscape around you began to change subtly. The hills grew steeper, the trees more numerous, casting long shadows across the path. The air grew heavier, the promise of something more than just another overcast day hanging in the distance.</p>

The gradually crowding trees, the lengthening shadows, the convenient valleys and ditches, silently counting the places he himself could hide, were he so inclined, were he still in his previous line of work. He stopped at twenty though he could have kept going. The hackles on his neck began to stand on end.*

*Alastair did little to hide the irritation in his voice. He too was weary from travel, in need of a real respite from the road. But winging about it would not shorten the distance they had yet to walk, would not relieve the ache from their legs, nor lighten the loads on their backs. He looked to the sky for an omen in the clouds, a sign from the heavens as to their coming fortunes, but  the sky was a monotone grey miasma with nothing to be gleaned from it except an increasingly likewise grey disposition.*

                <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> The hours passed, marked only by the steady rhythm of footsteps and the rustling of leaves in the cool breeze. The sky remained an unbroken expanse of gray, the sun hidden behind layers of cloud, casting a dim, diffused light over the landscape. The once gentle breeze began to carry a sharper edge, hinting at the storm that loomed on the horizon.

The path twisted and turned through the dense woodland, the trees pressing closer together, their branches intertwining overhead to form a canopy that muted the world beneath it. The air grew thick with the scent of damp earth and pine, a reminder of the night's lingering moisture.

The path began to climb, the incline gentle but steady, each step requiring more effort as the ground grew more uneven. The trees here were older, their trunks thick and gnarled, their roots breaking through the earth in twisted patterns. The distant rumble of thunder grew more frequent, a low, ominous growl that seemed to reverberate through the hills.

A gust of wind sent a shower of droplets from the canopy above, splashing onto the party and reminding them of the storm's potential return. The light began to fade, the day slipping toward dusk, casting long shadows that danced and flickered in the periphery of their vision.</p>

                <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Night had fallen, bringing with it the first drops of rain. They began as a light patter on the leaves, barely noticeable against the backdrop of the darkening sky. But soon, the rain picked up, turning into a steady downpour that soaked through clothing and chilled to the bone. The distant rumble of thunder grew closer, promising a storm that would not be ignored.

The path ahead was barely visible in the encroaching darkness, the only light coming from the occasional flash of lightning illuminating the twisted branches overhead. The temperature dropped sharply, the cold seeping into muscles already weary from the day's march. Each step became an effort, the ground beneath their feet turning to slick mud.</p>

                <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Visibility was poor, the rain coming down in sheets that made it hard to see more than a few feet ahead. The road had become a river of mud, making progress slow and treacherous. Ludrec, Rue, and Alastair pressed on, their determination tested by the worsening conditions.

A sudden, brilliant flash of lightning illuminated the world for a brief moment, revealing a two-story, stone structure up ahead. The building stood resolute against the storm, its wooden roof and twin chimneys silhouetted against the dark sky. From its windows, a warm, welcoming light spilled out, cutting through the night and the rain.</p>

The road had become an unrecognizable mire, and the wind whipped at their cloaks with merciless fervor. The three adventurers trudged on, their eyes fixed on the distant glow that promised refuge from the elements.

As they drew closer, the structure came into clearer view. It was a sturdy two-story building, its stone walls standing firm against the battering rain. The wooden roof, dark and glistening with moisture, bore two chimneys that emitted thin wisps of smoke, barely visible in the dim light. The warm glow from the windows spilled out into the night.

The sign hanging above the door swung slightly in the wind, its creaking barely audible over the storm's din. In the light from the windows, they could make out the name: Traveler's Blessing.</p>

                <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> Ludrec pulled his cloak tighter around his shoulders as he approached the window, seeking the shelter of the building’s overhang. The rain continued its relentless assault, the droplets forming a shimmering curtain that obscured the world beyond. He moved with purpose, each step sinking slightly into the muddy ground, a reminder of the storm's persistence.

Reaching the window, Ludrec wiped the water from his brow and leaned closer, peering through the glass. The light from inside spilled out, casting a soft glow that contrasted sharply with the dark, rain-soaked night. He could feel the warmth radiating from within, a tantalizing promise of comfort and respite.

Through the window, Ludrec could see the common room of the inn. The interior was modest but inviting, with wooden tables and chairs scattered around a crackling hearth. The firelight danced on the walls, creating flickering shadows that added to the room's cozy ambiance. Patrons huddled at the tables, their faces flushed from the heat and animated in quiet conversation. The smell of stew and fresh bread wafted through the air, reaching Ludrec even through the window.

A slight man moved between the tables, his demeanor warm and welcoming, though his eyes were sharp and observant. He spoke with the ease of someone used to listening as much as talking, his presence commanding quiet respect from the patrons. Near the bar, a woman moved with practiced efficiency, serving drinks and clearing dishes, her movements swift and sure. Two young boys darted around, helping where they could, their laughter a light counterpoint to the hum of conversation.

Ludrec lingered for a moment, soaking in the scene. The warmth, the light, the laughter—it all felt like a different world compared to the cold, wet night outside.</p>

The contrast between the cold, relentless storm outside and the warm, inviting interior of the inn creates a moment of silent understanding between them.

                <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> ***The door to the inn swung open with a creak, the warm, inviting light spilling out into the stormy night. Alastair stepped inside, the chill of the rain giving way to the comforting heat of the hearth. The room was a haven of warmth and light, a stark contrast to the relentless downpour outside.

As Alastair entered, the hum of conversation briefly quieted, the patrons glancing up before returning to their discussions. The crackling fire cast dancing shadows on the walls, and the smell of rich stew and freshly baked bread filled the air, mingling with the scent of burning wood.

The innkeeper, a slight man with sharp eyes and a welcoming smile, approached. He moved with the ease of someone well accustomed to his role, his eyes quickly assessing the new arrival.*

> "Welcome, traveler," he said, his voice warm and clear above the background murmur. "Come in, come in. Get out of that dreadful weather. We've got a warm fire and hot food. What can I get for you?"

*The innkeeper's greeting was sincere, his demeanor inviting. Nearby, the woman behind the bar continued her work, her movements fluid and efficient, while the two boys darted around, tending to the needs of the patrons.

As Alastair made his way further inside, the comforting atmosphere enveloped him. The room was modest but cozy, with wooden tables and chairs arranged around the hearth. The patrons were a mix of locals and travelers, their faces reflecting the same relief and contentment that Alastair felt.

The door remained open for a moment longer, allowing Ludrec and Rue to follow, the storm's roar momentarily louder before the door closed again, sealing out the cold and wet.***</p>

> "Of course, of course. A warm meal, a cold ale, and a dry bed are exactly what we specialize in here. Please, make yourselves comfortable by the hearth. I'll have the food and drink brought to you shortly."

*He gestured towards an empty table near the fire, the closest one to the welcoming warmth of the flames. The other patrons barely glanced up, more engrossed in their own conversations and meals now that the initial curiosity had passed.

The woman behind the bar cast a quick, approving glance at the innkeeper before turning her attention back to her tasks. The two boys, sensing the arrival of new guests, quickly moved to set the table with practiced efficiency.

As Ludrec, Rue, and Alastair made their way to the table, the fire's heat began to thaw the chill from their bones. The smell of the stew was stronger here, rich and savory, mingling with the scent of freshly baked bread. The sound of the rain outside became a distant murmur, a reminder of the harsh world from which they had momentarily escaped.

The innkeeper lingered for a moment, making sure they were settled before he turned to Rue with a thoughtful expression.*

> "As for your friend Aldric, I'm afraid I haven't heard that name recently. We get all sorts passing through here, though, so it's always possible someone might know something. Once you've had a chance to rest, feel free to ask around. Folks here are generally friendly enough."

Don't talk much, if at all. Maybe they know something about your friend. They've been nosing around the area, acting a bit peculiar if you ask me."

> "Ah, those monks," Tal begins, his voice steady. "They've been a bit of a mystery, to be honest. They arrived a few days ago, didn't speak a word, just nodded and went about their business. From what I gathered, they were heading towards the old abbey on the other side of Durham's Hill. It's been quiet there for years, ever since old Father Dosol took over."

*He leans in a bit closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper.*

> "There's something off about them, if you ask me. They don't mingle with the locals, and the way they move...it's almost like they're avoiding attention. I'd be careful if I were you."

*The innkeeper straightens up, his usual cheerful demeanor returning.*

> "But enough of that for now. Enjoy your meal, and if you have any other questions, don't hesitate to ask. My sister and I are here to help."

*With a final nod, Tal steps away, leaving the adventurers to ponder his words and enjoy the hearty meal before them. The rich aroma of the rabbit stew and the warmth of the ale seem to bring a momentary respite from their worries, though the mystery of the monks lingers in the back of their minds.***</p>

> He pauses, leaning in slightly. "As for the monks, they were headed towards Haggash, just past Durham's Hill. It's a small place, not much to look at, but it's got a few spots you might find interesting. There's Dreab's store, though his prices can be a bit steep. The livery is run by Derrik, an old army officer who might be of some help. And then there's the abbey itself, where the monks have been spending most of their time."

> Tal's voice drops to a conspiratorial whisper. "The folks in Haggash are a cautious lot, quick to react but slow to act. If you need information or supplies, you might have to dig a bit."

> He straightens up, his usual cheerful demeanor returning. "I'll have the boys start packing up some rations for you. Anything else you need, just let me know. And good luck with your investigation."**</p>

> She glances around the room, ensuring no one else is within earshot, then continues. "People talk, especially after a few ales. I've heard plenty of stories, some true, some less so. But those monks... they've got everyone on edge. Came in quiet as shadows, and they've stayed that way. It's not natural, if you ask me."

> Assa straightens up, giving Rue a shrewd look. "If you're planning on sticking your nose into their business, just be careful."

> She pats Rue's arm reassuringly before turning to attend to another patron, her parting words lingering. "If you need anything else, just holler. And keep your wits about you, traveler."**</p>

But the third drink hits a bit harder than the first two, and he sways slightly, the room around him blurring at the edges.*

*Assa raises an eyebrow at Rue's bravado, a smile tugging at the corner of her lips. She takes the empty mug from his hand, her eyes sparkling with a mix of amusement and caution.*

> "One more for the road, huh?" she echoes, turning to fill the mug once more. The golden liquid cascades into the cup, frothing at the top, the scent rich and inviting. She hands it back to Rue with a knowing look. "Just be sure that road doesn't turn into a ditch."

*His vision steadies after a moment, his constitution holding firm against the onslaught of alcohol, but he knows he's reached his limit. Any more, and the road might indeed become a ditch. Assa watches him with a mix of approval and concern, ready to catch him if he stumbles.*

                <p><span style="color: skyblue;"></span> ***The storm continued to rage outside the Traveler's Blessing as the adventurers prepared for bed, the wind howling and rain beating against the inn’s sturdy walls.*

*The night passed uneventfully, the warmth of the hearth and the comfort of the beds providing much-needed respite. Morning arrived with no change in the weather; the rain showed no signs of letting up, and the skies remained an unbroken expanse of gray.*

*In the common room, the adventurers found Tal and Assa already awake and bustling about. Tal greeted them with a nod, his expression serious.*

> "Morning," he said, handing over a bundle of rations. "I've packed enough to last you a few days. The weather's not looking any better, so you'll want to be prepared." He added, “That’ll be 4.5 gold pieces.”

*The adventurers gathered their gear and prepared to step back into the storm. The rain pounded relentlessly, turning the path into a muddy slog. Despite the discomfort, they were driven by the need to uncover the mystery surrounding the monks and the abbey.*

*As they left the warmth of the Traveler's Blessing behind, the world outside felt colder and more foreboding. The rain-soaked landscape stretched out before them, Durham's Hill looming in the distance.*

*The path ahead was slick and treacherous, the sound of the rain and wind making conversation difficult. The small cluster of buildings that made up Haggash slowly came into view, shrouded in the persistent downpour.***</p>
